# obs-websocket-dotnet
A .NET library wrote in C# to communicate with an obs-websocket server. Depends on [websocket-sharp](https://github.com/sta/websocket-sharp) and [JSON.Net](http://www.newtonsoft.com/json).

### Notice
This is a fork repo but it's update/use for **my personal projects**. So there's no any plan about PR and no techical support.
